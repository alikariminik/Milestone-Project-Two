## What is this ReadME for?
This is the ReadMe for the website for the fictional web application called FlyMeTo. FlyMeTo is a web-based app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its target audience are those who are looking for a potential holiday destination. Through the asking of some questions, the application will suggest a potential holiday location based off of the answers users give.

## UX

### The Strategy Plane
* FlyMeTo intends on being a creative way of helping users find their next potential holiday destination. Through the use of asking the user questions, with the aid of emotion-provoking images, the app aims to suggest a holiday location based of the user’s answers.

#### Site Goals
* To provide users with a fun and creative way of identifying their next holiday destination.
* To ensure that the app is easy to use and quick in suggesting potential locations.

Features Planned
* A single page which includes all the sites features.

### The Skeleton Plane
#### Wireframe Mockups 
I utilised Balsamiq to produce my wireframes of how the app would appear across different devices. The app was intended to be contained within one page, however as the app required different content to be loaded at different times, the wireframes display a combination of different views of the site, with the introductory view and images seen in one and then the final page view adjacent to it.

### The Surface Plane

#### Design 
#### Colour Scheme
I used a colour scheme which I felt conveyed the feelings of Summer which is arguably the most the popular time of year to go on holiday: Yellow = Sun, Orange = Sand, Blue = Ocean. I used the site Coolors to devise this colour palette. The exact colour palette can be viewed via the link below which directs to the site Coolors -

#### Typography
I used the  'Lobstr' font for the Logo with 'Cursive' as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I found 'Lobstr' through Google Fonts and I felt as though this font; when displaying the name of the website "Fly Me To... provided a clear and attractive looking logo instead of spending time designing a genuine logo.

For the introductory text, I used the 'Merriweather Sans' font in italics with 'Sans-Serif' as the fallback font. I found that 'Merriweather Sans' was a quite subtle font which was very legible and easy to read multiple lines of clearly without being distracting. 'Merriweather Sans' was used again for the "Home" button for this same reason and I found that it makes sense for this font to represent the navigational link to the home page which had the introductory text in 'Merriweather Sans'.  

'Lobstr' was used again for the style of the questions asked. This in conjunction with the ever-present 'Merriweather Sans' Fly Me To logo allows the user to connect the logo and the subsequent questions together so that the page reads as follows: "Fly Me to 'Beaches or Mountains'?, "Fly Me to 'Adventures or Relaxation'?" etc. 

Finally, for the exact same reasoning as before, 'Lobstr' was used again for the style of the suggested destination location eg. "Fly Me to Paris, France?.
