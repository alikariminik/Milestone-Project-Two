## What is this ReadME for?
This is the ReadMe for the website for the fictional web application called FlyMeTo. FlyMeTo is a web-based app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its target audience are those who are looking for a potential holiday destination. Through the asking of some questions, the application will suggest a potential holiday location based off of the answers users give.

### The Skeleton Plane
#### Wireframe Mockups 
I utilised Balsamiq to produce my wireframes of how the app would appear across different devices. The app was intended to be contained within one page, however as the app required different content to be loaded at different times, the wireframes display a combination of different views of the site, with the introductory view and images seen in one and then the final page view adjacent to it.
